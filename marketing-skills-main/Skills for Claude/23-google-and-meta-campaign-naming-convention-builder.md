# 23/ Campaign Naming Convention Builder — Google + Meta

## What it does
Builds a consistent, filterable naming convention across your Google and Meta accounts based on your campaign types, objectives, targeting, and reporting needs. Makes filtering, reporting, and cross-platform analysis actually work instead of guessing what "Campaign_v3_Final_NEW" means.

## How it works
Claude looks at your current account structure, campaign types, targeting approaches, and reporting requirements, then designs a naming taxonomy that encodes the key attributes you need to slice data by. It covers campaigns, ad sets/ad groups, and ads — all with a consistent format that works across platforms and with your reporting tools.

## Practical example
Your current naming is a mix of "Spring Sale - Lookalike" and "FB_Prospecting_Interest_test2_FINAL". Claude designs a convention: [Platform]_[Objective]_[Funnel Stage]_[Targeting Type]_[Audience/Keyword Theme]_[Geo]_[Date]. So "META_CONV_PROSP_LAL_1pct-Purchasers_US_2024Q2" tells you everything at a glance. It also generates a reference sheet, naming rules for new campaigns, and a script to bulk-rename existing campaigns to the new format.

## What you get back
- Naming convention format with each component explained
- Full taxonomy of values for each component (all targeting types, objectives, funnel stages you use)
- Reference sheet for anyone on the team to follow
- Bulk rename list mapping current names to new convention
- Recommendations for UTM parameter alignment so your naming convention matches analytics tracking

## When to use it
- When onboarding a new team member who needs to navigate the account
- When taking over messy accounts and need to bring order before optimizing
- Before scaling to multiple markets or products where naming discipline becomes critical
- When building cross-platform reporting dashboards that need consistent naming to aggregate data correctly
