# 1/ CPA Diagnostics — Google + Meta

## What it does
When your CPA spikes, Claude breaks down exactly what caused it. It looks across your campaign data and isolates the contributing factors — audience fatigue, bid landscape shifts, creative decay, landing page conversion drops, budget distribution changes, or new competitor activity.

## How it works
Feed Claude your campaign data for the current period vs the previous period. It compares metrics at every level — campaign, ad set, ad, keyword, audience, placement — and identifies where the variance is coming from. Results are ranked by impact so you know what to fix first.

## Practical example
CPA went from $42 to $67 overnight. Claude identifies that 73% of the increase came from one ad set where frequency hit 4.2 and CTR dropped 31%. Another 18% came from a search campaign where a broad match keyword started matching irrelevant queries. The remaining 9% was a landing page with slower load time after a site update.

## What you get back
- Ranked list of factors driving the CPA change with percentage contribution
- Specific campaigns, ad sets, keywords, or audiences causing the issue
- Recommended fixes for each factor in priority order
- Comparison data showing exactly what shifted between periods

## When to use it
- CPA jumps more than 15-20% day over day or week over week
- Client asks "why did performance drop" and you need an answer fast
- Monday morning account checks when you need to catch weekend issues
- Before budget calls to identify and fix problems proactively
