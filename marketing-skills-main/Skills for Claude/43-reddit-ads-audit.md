# Reddit Ads Audit

Analyze Reddit ad campaigns for community-driven performance optimization.

## Process

1. **Request campaign data** - Reddit Ads Manager export or pasted metrics
2. **Analyze subreddit targeting** - Community relevance, size, engagement
3. **Check creative fit** - Native vs promotional feel
4. **Evaluate bidding** - CPM/CPC efficiency by placement
5. **Identify audience issues** - Interest targeting vs subreddit targeting
6. **Deliver prioritized fixes**

## Reddit Ads Benchmarks

| Metric | Good | Average | Poor |
|--------|------|---------|------|
| CTR (Feed) | >0.5% | 0.2-0.5% | <0.2% |
| CTR (Conversation) | >1% | 0.5-1% | <0.5% |
| CPC | <$1.50 | $1.50-3 | >$3 |
| CPM | <$5 | $5-10 | >$10 |
| Engagement Rate | >3% | 1-3% | <1% |
| Conversion Rate | >2% | 1-2% | <1% |

## Subreddit Targeting Analysis

### Red Flags
- Targeting broad interest categories only (no specific subreddits)
- Subreddits with <50K members (too small for scale)
- Subreddits with >5M members (too broad, wasted spend)
- Mismatched subreddit culture (promotional tone in anti-ad communities)
- Not excluding default/general subreddits

### Sweet Spot
- 100K-1M member subreddits
- Niche but active communities
- Communities where your product is naturally discussed
- Multiple related subreddits grouped by theme

## Creative Fit Checklist

Reddit users hate obvious ads. Check:

- [ ] Headline sounds like a Reddit post (not ad copy)
- [ ] No stock photos (use screenshots, real images)
- [ ] Copy uses community language
- [ ] Not overly promotional/salesy
- [ ] Includes social proof or results
- [ ] CTA is soft (not "BUY NOW")

**Good**: "We built a tool that does X. Here's what we learned."
**Bad**: "🚀 Amazing Software - 50% OFF - Limited Time! 🚀"

## Bidding & Budget Issues

| Issue | Signal | Fix |
|-------|--------|-----|
| Overpaying for impressions | High CPM, low CTR | Switch to CPC bidding |
| Low delivery | Budget not spending | Increase bid or broaden targeting |
| Poor placement mix | All spend on one placement | Test conversation ads |
| Audience too narrow | High CPC, low volume | Add related subreddits |

### Subreddit Targeting Assessment
**Current targeting**: Broad "Technology" interest
**Issues**:
- Too broad - reaching millions who don't need PM software
- No specific subreddits selected
- Wasting budget on irrelevant impressions

**Recommended subreddits to add**:
- r/projectmanagement (200K) - direct audience
- r/startups (800K) - decision makers
- r/SaaS (50K) - software buyers
- r/Entrepreneur (2M) - business owners

### Creative Fit Score: 3/10
- ❌ "Best" claim = instant skip
- ❌ Sounds like generic ad copy
- ❌ No social proof or story

**Suggested rewrite**: "We switched from Asana to our own tool. Here's why (and the template we use)"

### Top Issues
| Priority | Issue | Impact | Fix |
|----------|-------|--------|-----|
| 1 | Broad interest targeting | 80% wasted spend | Target specific subreddits |
| 2 | Promotional creative | Low CTR | Rewrite as native content |

### Confidence Level: HIGH
```

## Guidelines

- Reddit audience hates obvious advertising - always check creative fit
- Subreddit targeting beats interest targeting 90% of the time
- If CTR is low, creative is usually the problem
- Recommend specific subreddits based on the product/service
- Ask about comment sentiment if available (negative comments kill performance)
