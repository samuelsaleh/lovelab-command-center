Google and Meta

# 30/ Weekly Account Summary — Google + Meta

## What it does
Generates a plain English summary of everything that happened across all your accounts this week. What improved, what declined, what needs immediate attention, and what to prioritize next week. The Monday morning briefing that saves you an hour of pulling reports and context-switching between platforms.

## How it works
Claude processes your weekly performance data across Google and Meta, compares it to the previous week and trailing 4-week average, identifies the most meaningful changes (not just any change, but changes that matter financially), and writes a structured briefing in the order you'd want to read it — fires first, wins second, and housekeeping third.

## Practical example
"Week of March 10: Total spend $41,200 (on pace). Three things to know — (1) Meta prospecting CPA jumped 22% to $46, driven by creative fatigue on the UGC set that's been running 4 weeks, recommend rotating in the new testimonial variants by Wednesday. (2) Google Search branded CPC dropped 15% after Competitor X apparently pulled back on brand bidding, good news, no action needed. (3) PMax added 23 new converting search terms this week, 4 of them are high-intent terms worth adding as exact match keywords in dedicated campaigns. Top win: the new carousel ad set is delivering $28 CPA at 2.1x ROAS after 5 days, scaling opportunity if it holds through next week."

## What you get back
