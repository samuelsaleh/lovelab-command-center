# 7/ Search Term Mining — Google

## What it does
Analyzes your search term reports across all campaigns and surfaces high-intent terms you're not bidding on yet. Groups them by theme, estimates their potential volume and CPA, and recommends match types and starting bids for each.

## How it works
Claude processes your search term data over a 30-90 day window, identifies converting terms that are currently matched through broad or phrase but don't have dedicated keywords, and separates them from noise. It also finds patterns — clusters of related terms that suggest new ad group or campaign opportunities you're missing.

## Practical example
Across your SaaS client's 8 search campaigns, Claude finds 67 converting search terms that don't have exact match keywords. It groups them into 5 themes: integration-specific queries (Salesforce, HubSpot), use-case queries (lead scoring, pipeline tracking), comparison queries (vs Competitor X), pricing queries, and enterprise-specific terms. Each group comes with estimated monthly volume, current CPA from broad match, and recommended starting bids.

## What you get back
- Keyword opportunities grouped by theme with volume estimates
- Current performance data for each term (impressions, clicks, conversions, CPA)
- Recommended match type and starting bid for each new keyword
- New ad group or campaign structure suggestions based on term clusters
- Negative keyword recommendations to prevent overlap with existing campaigns

## When to use it
- Monthly keyword expansion reviews
- When search campaigns plateau and you need new growth vectors
- After launching a new product or feature that creates new search demand
- When onboarding a new account to find what the previous team missed
