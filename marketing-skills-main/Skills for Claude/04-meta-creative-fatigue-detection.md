# 4/ Creative Fatigue Detection — Meta

## What it does
Monitors your ads for early signs of fatigue before performance fully collapses. Tracks frequency buildup, CTR decay, CPM increases, and engagement drops across all active creatives and tells you which ones need rotation now vs next week.

## How it works
Claude looks at daily performance trends for each ad — CTR trajectory, frequency accumulation, cost per result movement, and engagement rate changes. It flags ads showing consistent decline over 3+ days and categorizes them as urgent (replace now), warning (1-2 weeks left), or healthy (still performing).

## Practical example
You're running 14 ads across 5 ad sets on Meta. Claude flags 3 ads as urgent — they've lost 40%+ CTR over 8 days with frequency above 3.5. Four more are in warning status with CTR declining 5-10% per day. The remaining 7 are still healthy. Claude also notes that your top performer from last month has shifted from urgent to dead — it's been running 6 weeks and the audience has seen it an average of 5.8 times.

## What you get back
- Each ad categorized as urgent, warning, or healthy with supporting data
- Days of useful life remaining for warning-status ads
- Frequency and CTR trend data for each creative
- Recommended rotation schedule based on current trajectory
- Which audiences have been overexposed to which creatives

## When to use it
- Weekly creative health checks across all active campaigns
- Before creative review meetings to prioritize what needs replacing
- When CPA starts creeping up and you suspect creative is the cause
- After scaling campaigns, because higher budgets burn through creatives faster
