# 12/ Day/Hour Performance Breakdown — Google + Meta

## What it does
Analyzes performance by day of week and hour of day across your campaigns. Identifies when your ads perform best and worst, recommends ad schedule adjustments with estimated savings, and tells you exactly what you'd give up by restricting hours.

## How it works
Claude segments your performance data by day and hour, looking at CPA, CVR, CTR, and spend distribution. It identifies statistically meaningful patterns (not just noise from low-volume hours) and calculates the cost of running ads during underperforming windows vs the conversions you'd lose by turning them off.

## Practical example
Your B2B SaaS campaigns show CPA of $31 during weekday business hours (8am-6pm) but $67 on weekends and $54 after 9pm. Weekend spend accounts for $4,200/month producing 63 leads at $67 each. Claude calculates that cutting weekends and nights saves $6,100/month in spend while losing only 89 conversions — but reallocating that budget to peak hours would generate an estimated 142 conversions at the lower CPA. Net gain: 53 additional conversions.

## What you get back
- Heatmap of CPA/CVR by day and hour with statistical confidence levels
- Specific schedule recommendations with exact hours and days to adjust
- Financial impact: spend saved, conversions lost, and net effect of reallocation
- Separate analysis for each campaign type (brand, prospecting, retargeting) since patterns differ
- Seasonal comparison showing if day/hour patterns shift by month or quarter

## When to use it
- When setting up ad schedules for new campaigns
- Quarterly reviews to adjust schedules as behavior patterns shift
- When budgets are tight and you need to maximize efficiency
- For B2B accounts where business hours vs off-hours performance differs significantly
