# Email Sequence Writer

Create complete email sequences with strategic timing, copywriting frameworks, and voice consistency.

## Process

1. **Gather context** - ICP, offer, main objections, brand voice
2. **Map sequence structure** - Purpose of each email, timing
3. **Apply copywriting formulas** - AIDA, PAS, BAB per email
4. **Write subject lines** - Test multiple angles
5. **Draft full emails** - Subject, preview, body, CTA
6. **Ensure voice consistency** - Maintain tone throughout

## Sequence Framework (5-Day Nurture)

| Day | Purpose | Content Focus |
|-----|---------|---------------|
| 1 | Welcome + Deliver | Deliver lead magnet, set expectations |
| 2 | Address Problem | Agitate main pain point |
| 3 | Provide Value | Quick win, build trust |
| 4 | Share Proof | Case study, testimonial, results |
| 5 | Present Offer | Clear CTA, deadline if applicable |

## Copywriting Formulas

| Formula | Structure | Best For |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| **AIDA** | Attention → Interest → Desire → Action | Standard promotional |
| **PAS** | Problem → Agitate → Solution | Pain-point focused |
| **BAB** | Before → After → Bridge | Transformation stories |
| **PASOP** | Problem → Agitation → Solution → Outcome → New Problem | Drip sequences (creates open loops) |

## Subject Line Formulas

| Type | Formula | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Question | Ask about their pain | "Are you making this mistake with your email list?" |
| Urgency | Time-bound action | "Last call: Offer closes in 3 hours" |
| Curiosity | Create intrigue | "I was wrong about everything..." |
| Numbers | Specific list/results | "7 lessons I learned doubling traffic" |
| Personal | Use name + question | "[Name], quick question about your goals" |
| Benefit | Direct value statement | "How to save 10 hours this week" |

## Subject Line Best Practices

- Length: 4-7 words (40-60 characters)
- Mobile preview: 25-30 characters visible
- Personalization: +22% open rate lift
- Emoji: Use sparingly, test by audience
- Avoid spam triggers: FREE, URGENT, !!!

**Send**: Immediately after signup
**Subject Line Options**:
1. "Your account is ready (5-min setup inside)"

**Preview Text**: Most users see their first results within an hour

**Body**:

Hey [Name],

Welcome to [Product] — you just made your marketing team's life easier.

I know you're busy (who isn't?), so I'll keep this short.

Here's the fastest way to get value:

**1. Connect your data source** (takes 2 minutes)
**2. Run your first report** (automatic)
**3. Share with your team** (one click)

That's it. Most users complete setup in under 5 minutes.

### Email 2: Address the Time Objection
**Send**: +1 day
**Subject Line Options**:
1. "The real reason you don't have time"
2. "What if you had 5 extra hours this week?"
3. "Quick question about your reporting process"

**Preview Text**: It's not you. It's your current tools.

**Body**:

Hey [Name],

Here's something I hear a lot:

"We don't have time to learn another tool."

I get it. Completely.

But here's what I've noticed: the teams who say this are usually spending 5+ hours a week on manual reporting.

Pulling data from three platforms. Building slides. Updating spreadsheets.

**What if that became automatic?**

That's not "learning a new tool" — that's buying back your week.

One of our customers, Sarah (Marketing Director at [Company]), told us:

*"I used to spend every Friday afternoon on reports. Now I spend it on strategy."*

Worth 5 minutes to see if that could be you?
