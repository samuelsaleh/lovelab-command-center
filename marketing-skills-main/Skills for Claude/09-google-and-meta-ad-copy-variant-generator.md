# 9/ Ad Copy Variant Generator — Google + Meta

## What it does
Analyzes your top performing ads, identifies what's working in the hooks, CTAs, messaging angles, and formats, then generates new variants that follow the same winning patterns while introducing enough variation to test meaningfully.

## How it works
Claude ingests your ad performance data alongside the actual ad copy and creative specs. It correlates performance metrics (CTR, CVR, CPA) with copy elements — headline structure, primary text length, tone, CTA type, pain point vs benefit framing, social proof usage. Then it generates variants that preserve the winning elements while changing specific variables.

## Practical example
Your best performing Meta ad has a hook that leads with a specific number ("Cut your onboarding time from 3 weeks to 3 days"), uses a customer quote in the middle, and ends with a soft CTA. Claude generates 8 variants: 4 keep the number-led hook pattern but change the metric, 2 test a question-based hook with the same body structure, and 2 flip to benefit-first with the number as proof. Each variant changes one or two elements so you can isolate what's actually driving performance.

## What you get back
- New ad copy variants grouped by what's being tested (hook, body, CTA)
- Annotation showing which winning element each variant preserves
- Recommended test priority based on which element has the most variance in your data
- Platform-specific formatting (character limits respected for Google RSAs vs Meta primary text)
- A/B test structure showing which variants to pair against each other

## When to use it
- When top creatives start fatiguing and you need fresh variants fast
- Creative brainstorm sessions where you need a starting point, not a blank page
- When scaling to new audiences that might respond to different angles
- RSA headline and description generation where you need 15 headlines that aren't repetitive
