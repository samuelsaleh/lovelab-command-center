# 10/ Landing Page Audit — Google + Meta

## What it does
Reviews your landing pages against the ads driving traffic to them. Checks for message match between ad copy and page content, CTA clarity, above-the-fold alignment, form friction, and flags any disconnects between what the ad promises and what the page delivers.

## How it works
Claude takes your ad copy and landing page content side by side. It evaluates whether the headline on the page matches the hook in the ad, whether the offer is consistent, whether the CTA is visible and clear, and whether the page structure follows conversion best practices for your specific campaign objective (lead gen, ecommerce, SaaS trial, etc).

## Practical example
Your Google Search ad promises "Free 14-day trial, no credit card required" but the landing page headline says "Start your journey with [Product]" and the CTA says "Get Started" with no mention of the free trial until below the fold. Claude flags the message mismatch, the vague headline, and the buried offer. It also notes that the form asks for company size and phone number — two fields known to increase drop-off for top-of-funnel offers.

## What you get back
- Message match score between each ad and its landing page
- Specific disconnects flagged with recommendations to fix
- Form friction analysis — which fields are likely causing drop-off
- Above-the-fold assessment for mobile and desktop
- CTA clarity rating with suggested improvements
- Comparison against your other landing pages that convert better

## When to use it
- When CVR drops but ad metrics (CTR, CPC) stay stable — the problem is usually the page
- Before launching new campaigns to catch issues before spend starts
- Quarterly landing page reviews across all active campaigns
- When A/B testing landing pages and you need hypotheses for what to change
