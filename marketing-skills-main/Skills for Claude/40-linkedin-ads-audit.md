# LinkedIn Ads Audit

Analyze LinkedIn ad campaigns for B2B performance optimization.

## Process

1. **Request campaign data** - Campaign Manager export or pasted metrics
2. **Benchmark performance** - Compare against LinkedIn B2B benchmarks
3. **Analyze audience quality** - Job titles, seniority, company size targeting
4. **Check lead gen forms** - Field count, friction points, completion rates
5. **Evaluate budget efficiency** - CPL, CPC, spend distribution
6. **Deliver prioritized fixes**

## LinkedIn Ads Benchmarks (B2B)

| Metric | Good | Average | Poor |
|--------|------|---------|------|
| CTR (Sponsored Content) | >0.5% | 0.3-0.5% | <0.3% |
| CTR (Text Ads) | >0.03% | 0.01-0.03% | <0.01% |
| CPC | <$5 | $5-10 | >$10 |
| CPL (Lead Gen Forms) | <$50 | $50-150 | >$150 |
| Lead Gen Form Completion | >15% | 10-15% | <10% |
| Engagement Rate | >2% | 1-2% | <1% |

## Audience Quality Checklist

- [ ] Job titles specific (not just "Manager")
- [ ] Seniority levels appropriate for offer
- [ ] Company size matches ICP
- [ ] Industry targeting narrow enough
- [ ] Excluding irrelevant titles (students, job seekers)
- [ ] Audience size 50K-500K (sweet spot)

## Lead Gen Form Friction Analysis

| Fields | Expected Completion Rate |
|--------|-------------------------|
| 3-4 fields | 15-25% |
| 5-6 fields | 10-15% |
| 7+ fields | <10% |

**High-friction fields to avoid:**
- Phone number (unless essential)
- Company revenue
- Custom text fields
- Multiple dropdowns

**Use instead:**
- Pre-filled LinkedIn data (name, email, company, title)
- Single dropdown for key qualification

## Budget Efficiency Issues

| Issue | Signal | Fix |
|-------|--------|-----|
| Overspending on awareness | High impressions, low CTR | Narrow audience |
| Audience too broad | Low CPL but poor lead quality | Add exclusions |
| Creative fatigue | CTR declining week-over-week | Refresh ads |
| Wrong objective | High CPC on brand awareness | Switch to lead gen |

## Guidelines

- Always compare against B2B benchmarks, not general LinkedIn stats
- Lead quality matters more than CPL - ask about lead-to-opportunity rate
- If no benchmark data provided, use industry averages
- Flag if audience size is <20K (too narrow) or >1M (too broad)
