Google and Meta

# 2/ Wasted Spend Finder — Google + Meta

## What it does
Scans your Google and Meta accounts for money being spent on search terms, placements, audiences, and ads that produce zero or near-zero conversions. Delivers clean exclusion lists you can upload directly.

## How it works
Claude analyzes your search term reports, placement reports, and audience segment data over a time window you choose (typically 30-90 days). It flags anything with meaningful spend but no conversions, and groups the results into actionable categories — negative keywords by theme, placement exclusions by type, and audience segments to remove.

## Practical example
Across 12 campaigns over 60 days, Claude finds $6,800 spent on 340 search terms with zero conversions. It groups them into 8 negative keyword themes (competitor names, informational queries, wrong intent, geographic mismatches). It also flags 23 mobile app placements on Meta eating $1,200 with a 0.02% CTR and zero conversions. Total recoverable spend: $8,000/month.

## What you get back
- Negative keyword list grouped by theme, ready for upload
- Placement exclusion list for Google Display and Meta
- Audience segments worth removing or restructuring
- Dollar amount attached to each category so you can prioritize
- Recommended match types for negative keywords (exact vs phrase)

## When to use it
- Monthly account hygiene, should be a standard part of your workflow
- When onboarding a new client account for the first time
- After scaling campaigns when new queries and placements start leaking in
- Before budget increase requests to show you've cleaned up waste first
