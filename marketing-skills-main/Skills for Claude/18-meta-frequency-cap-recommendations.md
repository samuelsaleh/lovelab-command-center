# 18/ Frequency Cap Recommendations — Meta

## What it does
Analyzes frequency data across your Meta campaigns, identifies where you're overserving ads to the same people, and recommends frequency caps by campaign objective. Tells you the point where additional impressions stop driving conversions and start burning money.

## How it works
Claude correlates frequency levels with conversion rates, CTR, and CPA across your campaigns. It finds the inflection point for each campaign type — the frequency at which performance starts declining — and recommends caps that maximize reach and conversions while cutting waste from overexposure.

## Practical example
Your Meta prospecting campaigns show that conversion rate peaks at frequency 2.3 and drops 40% by frequency 4. But your current average frequency is 5.1, meaning a significant portion of impressions are hitting people who've already seen the ad too many times. Claude recommends a frequency cap of 3 per 7 days for prospecting. For retargeting, the data shows conversions continue up to frequency 6 before dropping — so a cap of 5 per 7 days is appropriate. Estimated savings from capping: $3,400/month redirected to fresh reach.

## What you get back
- Current frequency distribution across all campaigns
- Optimal frequency by campaign type based on your actual conversion data
- Recommended caps with projected spend savings
- Estimated additional reach you'd gain by redirecting overexposure spend to new users
- Frequency-to-conversion curve showing exactly where diminishing returns kick in

## When to use it
- When CPMs rise and you suspect audience saturation
- Monthly frequency audits across all Meta campaigns
- When scaling spend and frequency climbs as budgets increase
- After creative refreshes to reset frequency baselines and set new caps
