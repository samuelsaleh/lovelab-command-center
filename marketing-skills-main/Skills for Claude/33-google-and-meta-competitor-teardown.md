# Competitor Teardown

Analyze competitor landing pages for positioning, messaging, and conversion strategy insights.

## Process

1. **Capture the page** - URL for fetch or screenshot upload
2. **Extract value proposition** - Problem, ICP, transformation, unique mechanism
3. **Map messaging hierarchy** - Headline → Subheadline → Body → CTA flow
4. **Score systematically** - 100-point rubric
5. **Identify strengths and weaknesses** - Actionable competitive intelligence
6. **Generate strategic recommendations** - How to differentiate

## Value Proposition Analysis Framework

Answer these four questions from the competitor's page:

| Question | What to Look For |
|----------|-----------------|
| **What problem do they solve?** | Pain points mentioned, problem agitation |
| **Who is their ICP?** | Language cues, industry references, company size signals |
| **What transformation do they promise?** | Before/after, outcomes, results |
| **What's their unique mechanism?** | Proprietary method, technology, approach |

## Messaging Hierarchy Evaluation

| Element | Assessment Criteria |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Headline** | Matches intent? Clear benefit? Addresses pain? Most prominent? |
| **Subheadline** | Expands "how"? Reinforces UVP? Supports headline? |
| **Body Copy** | Framework used (AIDA/PAS/BAB)? Benefit-to-feature ratio? |
| **CTA** | Visible? Action-oriented verb? Value stated? Urgency present? |
| **Trust Signals** | Logos, testimonials, ratings, certifications, social proof? |

## 100-Point Scoring Rubric

| Category | Max Points | Scoring Criteria |
|----------|------------|------------------|
| Positioning Clarity | 15 | Clear problem/solution, obvious ICP, differentiation |
| Headline Effectiveness | 15 | Benefit-driven, specific, compelling |
| Copy Quality | 15 | Benefit-focused, scannable, persuasive |
| CTA Strategy | 15 | Visible, action-oriented, low friction |
| Trust Signals | 10 | Quality social proof, credibility markers |
| Visual Hierarchy | 10 | Clear flow, emphasis on key elements |
| Objection Handling | 10 | FAQ, guarantees, risk reversals |
| Pricing Presentation | 5 | Clear, justified, anchored |
| Brand Voice | 5 | Consistent, appropriate, memorable |

## Red Flags to Identify

- Vague headlines ("The best solution for your needs")
- Feature-heavy copy without benefits
- Multiple audiences addressed on single page
- Missing or buried value proposition
- Weak or generic CTAs ("Submit," "Learn More")
- No social proof or trust signals
- Cluttered design with competing elements

## Competitor Teardown: Notion

**Overall Score**: 78/100

### Value Proposition Analysis
- **Problem Solved**: Fragmented tools for notes, docs, wikis, projects
- **Target ICP**: Knowledge workers, teams, startups
- **Promised Transformation**: One workspace for all work
- **Unique Mechanism**: Flexible blocks system, templates

### Messaging Hierarchy
| Element | Content | Effectiveness |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| Headline | "Write, plan, organize, play" | 7/10 - Broad but memorable |
| Subheadline | "Turn ideas into action with Notion's AI-powered workspace" | 8/10 - Clear value |
| Primary CTA | "Get Notion free" | 9/10 - Low friction, value-focused |

### Strengths
1. **Social proof**: Trusted by logos prominent above fold
2. **Low-friction entry**: Free tier CTA reduces conversion resistance

### Weaknesses
1. **Vague headline**: Doesn't communicate specific outcome
2. **Broad ICP**: Page tries to speak to everyone

### Strategic Recommendations
1. Position against their broadness - own a specific use case deeply
2. Lead with concrete outcomes vs features

### Confidence Level: HIGH

## Guidelines

- If given screenshot only, note any sections not visible
- Extract exact quotes for messaging analysis
- Compare to best practices, not just personal opinion
- Always provide actionable differentiation strategies
- If URL inaccessible, ask for screenshot or describe limitations
