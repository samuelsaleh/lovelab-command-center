# Content Repurposer

Atomize pillar content into platform-optimized derivatives while preserving voice.

## Process

1. **Analyze source content** - Key points, structure, main takeaways
2. **Extract hooks** - Most compelling ideas for each platform
3. **Apply platform formats** - Length, structure, hashtags
4. **Maintain voice** - Consistent tone across derivatives
5. **Deliver complete package** - All formats ready to publish

## Content Atomization Target

**Ratio**: 1 pillar piece → 8+ derivative pieces

From one blog post, generate:
- 3-5 LinkedIn posts (different angles)
- 1 Twitter/X thread (5-10 tweets)
- 2-3 email snippets (newsletter teasers)
- 2-3 ad hooks (paid social)
- 1 short video script (15-60 seconds)

## Platform-Specific Requirements

### LinkedIn
| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| Length | 1,300-1,600 characters optimal |
| Hook | First 140 characters (before "See more") |
| Format | Short paragraphs, line breaks, emoji bullets optional |
| Hashtags | 3-5, placed at end |
| CTA | Soft (comment/share) or link in comments |

### Twitter/X Threads
| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| Length | 70-100 characters optimal per tweet |
| Thread format | Number tweets (1/7), create curiosity gaps |
| Hook | First tweet must stop scroll |
| Hashtags | 1-2 max per thread |
| End | CTA + repost request |

### Short Video Script (TikTok/Reels/Shorts)
| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| Length | 15-30 seconds (50-150 words) |
| Hook | 0-3 seconds must grab attention |
| Structure | Hook → Value → CTA |
| Style | Conversational, direct address |

### Email/Newsletter
| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| Teaser | 2-3 sentence summary |
| Bullets | 3-5 key takeaways |
| Featured insight | 1 quotable moment |
| CTA | Link to full piece |

## Hook Writing Formulas

| Type | Formula | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Contrarian | "Stop doing [common practice]" | "Stop posting content every day" |
| Question | "Ever wonder why [problem]?" | "Ever wonder why your posts get 12 likes?" |
| Number | "5 things I wish I knew about..." | "5 things I wish I knew about LinkedIn" |
| Challenge | "Most people get [topic] wrong" | "Most people get content repurposing wrong" |
| Story | "3 years ago, I was [situation]" | "3 years ago, I was posting into the void" |
| Result | "This one change got me [result]" | "This one change got me 10x engagement" |

## Voice Consistency Framework

Before repurposing, define:
- **Tone descriptors**: 3-5 adjectives (e.g., confident, helpful, witty)
- **Vocabulary list**: Words to use / words to avoid
- **Sentence style**: Short and punchy? Long and flowing?
- **Formality level**: Per platform adjustments

### Source Analysis
- **Core Message**: Most email marketing fails due to three fixable mistakes
- **Key Points**: Over-sending, no segmentation, weak subjects
- **Best Hooks**: "Your email list is dying" (fear), "3 mistakes" (number), "I deleted 50,000 subscribers" (story)

### LinkedIn Post 1: Contrarian Angle
```
Stop sending weekly newsletters.

I know. Controversial.

But here's what the data shows:

The "consistent" senders with 52 emails/year?
→ 15% open rates
→ 2% click rates
→ Growing unsubscribe rates

The strategic senders with 24 emails/year?
→ 35% open rates
→ 8% click rates
→ Shrinking lists that actually buy

More isn't better. Better is better.

The fix:
• Only send when you have real value
• Segment ruthlessly (not everyone needs everything)
• Write subjects like your revenue depends on it (it does)

Your list doesn't want more of you.
They want more value from you.

What's your current send frequency?

### Twitter/X Thread
```
1/ Your email list is slowly dying.

And you're probably accelerating it.

Here are 3 mistakes killing your open rates (and how to fix them):

🧵

2/ Mistake #1: You're sending too often

"Consistency" has become "spam."

Weekly newsletters = trained ignorance.

Fix: Send only when you have genuine value. Quality > frequency.

3/ Mistake #2: Everyone gets the same email

Your CEO and your intern have different needs.

But they get identical content.

Fix: Segment by behavior, not just demographics.

4/ Mistake #3: Your subject lines are invisible

"Monthly Newsletter - January Edition"

Delete.

Fix: Write subjects that create curiosity or promise specific value.

5/ The result of fixing these 3 things?

One client went from 12% → 38% open rates in 60 days.

Same list. Same product. Different approach.

6/ TL;DR:

• Send less, but better
• Segment ruthlessly  
• Write subjects that demand opens

Your list isn't dead. It's just bored.

### Video Script (25 seconds)

**[HOOK - 0-3 sec]**
"Your email list is dying and you're the one killing it."

**[VALUE - 4-20 sec]**
"Three mistakes: First, you're sending too often — weekly newsletters train people to ignore you. Second, everyone gets the same email — your CEO and intern have different needs. Third, your subject lines are invisible — 'Monthly Newsletter January' gets deleted."

**[CTA - 21-25 sec]**
"Fix these three things and watch your open rates double. Link in bio for the full breakdown."
```
