# 29/ Performance Benchmarking — Google + Meta

## What it does
Compares your key metrics against industry benchmarks for your specific vertical, campaign type, and platform. Tells you where you're ahead, where you're behind, and where there's room to improve — adjusted for your account size and spend level, because a $10K/month account and a $500K/month account have different benchmark realities.

## How it works
Claude takes your core metrics (CPC, CTR, CVR, CPA, ROAS, CPM) and compares them against available benchmark data for your industry and campaign type. It adjusts for factors that affect comparison — account maturity, geo, budget level, and funnel stage — so you're not comparing your prospecting CPA against someone else's retargeting CPA.

## Practical example
Your SaaS client's Google Search campaigns show a 3.2% CTR and $52 CPA. Claude benchmarks this against B2B SaaS averages: CTR is 18% above benchmark (strong ad relevance), but CPA is 30% above benchmark, with the gap primarily in CVR (2.1% vs benchmark 3.4%). This points to a landing page issue rather than an ad issue — your ads attract clicks at a good rate, but the landing page isn't converting them. For Meta, your CPM of $18 is right at benchmark, but your hook rate on video ads (22%) is well below the 35% benchmark, suggesting the first 3 seconds of your videos need work.

## What you get back
- Metric-by-metric comparison against industry benchmarks with variance percentages
- Where you're outperforming with context on why
- Where you're underperforming with likely root causes
- Prioritized improvement opportunities ranked by potential impact
- Benchmark context: what "good" looks like for your specific situation, not just industry averages

## When to use it
- When pitching new clients to identify quick wins in their accounts
- QBRs and annual reviews to show performance in context
- When clients ask "is our CPA good?" and need a data-backed answer
- For internal team benchmarking across multiple client accounts in the same vertical
