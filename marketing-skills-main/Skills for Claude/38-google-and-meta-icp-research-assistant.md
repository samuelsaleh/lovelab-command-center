### Day in the Life
Spends mornings reviewing expense reports and chasing receipts. Afternoons in meetings about budget vs actuals. End of month is chaos - reconciling expenses, closing books, preparing reports for leadership. Always behind.

### Goals
1. Close books faster (currently takes 10+ days)
2. Reduce expense policy violations
3. Get promoted to Director/VP Finance

### Pain Points
| Pain Point | Impact | Current Workaround |
|------------|--------|-------------------|
| Chasing receipts | 5+ hours/week | Email reminders, Slack nagging |
| Manual data entry | Errors, delays | Double-checking everything |
| Policy violations | Audit risk | Rejecting reports, re-work |
| Month-end crunch | Stress, overtime | Working weekends |

### Top Objections
| Objection | Underlying Concern | Response |
|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| "We use spreadsheets, it works" | Change is risky | Calculate time cost, show error rate |
| "Employees won't adopt it" | Implementation headache | Show mobile-first UX, adoption stats |
| "Need IT approval" | Complexity fear | No-code setup, SOC2 compliance |

### Buying Triggers
**Most likely to buy when:**
- Failed audit or compliance issue
- New CFO joins (wants to modernize)
- Company raises funding (needs better controls)
- Month-end close took 15+ days
- Key finance person quits (process breaks)

### Where They Hang Out
- LinkedIn - follows CFO influencers, finance groups
- Controller Council / AFP communities
- Google searches for templates and best practices

### Messaging Angles
| Angle | Headline Example |
|-------|------------------|
| Pain-focused | "Stop chasing receipts. Automate expense reports." |
| Outcome-focused | "Close your books 5 days faster" |
| Fear-focused | "Your expense reports won't survive an audit" |

### Keywords They Search
- "expense report software"
- "automate expense tracking"
- "expense policy template"
- "month end close faster"

### Confidence Level: MEDIUM
Would increase with: 5 customer interviews, win/loss analysis, search volume data
```

## Guidelines

- Always provide specific job titles, not just "decision maker"
- Pain points should be specific and visceral
- Objections must include response strategies
- Include where they consume content (for channel strategy)
- If product details are vague, ask clarifying questions
- Note confidence level and what would improve it
