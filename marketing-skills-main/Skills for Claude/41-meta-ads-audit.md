# Meta Ads Audit

Analyze Meta advertising accounts for structural issues, creative performance, and tracking health.

## Process

1. **Request account data** - Ads Manager exports (campaign, ad set, ad level with time series)
2. **Check creative fatigue signals** - Frequency, CTR trends, CPM inflation
3. **Analyze audience overlap** - Identify cannibalization between ad sets
4. **Verify tracking setup** - Pixel, Conversions API, Event Match Quality
5. **Evaluate campaign structure** - Advantage+ vs Manual decisions
6. **Deliver prioritized recommendations**

## Creative Fatigue Detection

| Signal | Threshold | Action Required |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| Frequency | >3-4 | Refresh creative or expand audience |
| CTR declining | >15-20% drop over 7 days | New creative needed |
| CPM rising | >30-40% over 2 weeks | Creative reset required |
| Ad Relevance | "Below Average" ranking | Immediate creative swap |

## Audience Overlap Analysis

**Scoring (use Facebook Audience Overlap Tool)**:
- 0-15% overlap = Safe, continue
- 15-30% overlap = Monitor, consider consolidation
- >30% overlap = Consolidate or add exclusions

## Tracking Verification Checklist

- [ ] Meta Pixel installed (use Pixel Helper Chrome extension)
- [ ] Conversions API (CAPI) configured with server-side events
- [ ] Event Match Quality score ≥6
- [ ] Browser events (blue) AND server events (green) firing in Events Manager
- [ ] iOS 14.5+ ATT prompt implemented
- [ ] Aggregated Event Measurement configured (8 events prioritized)

## Advantage+ vs Manual Decision Logic

**Use Advantage+ Shopping/App campaigns when**:
- Scaling established products
- Prospecting broad audiences
- Budget >$100/day for algorithm learning
- Have 50+ conversions/week

**Use Manual campaigns when**:
- Retargeting specific segments
- Testing new creatives
- Budget <$50/day
- Need precise audience control

## Guidelines

- Request at minimum 14 days of data for trend analysis
- If tracking data unavailable, note this as critical gap
- Never assume iOS tracking loss percentage - ask for actual data
- Flag frequency >7 as severe (audience exhaustion)
