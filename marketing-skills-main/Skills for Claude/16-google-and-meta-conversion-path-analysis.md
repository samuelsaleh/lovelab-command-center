Google and Meta

# 16/ Conversion Path Analysis — Google + Meta

## What it does
Maps out how users move through your funnel from first ad click to conversion. Identifies where the biggest drop-offs happen, which campaigns contribute most at each stage, and how long the typical conversion path takes across different audience segments.

## How it works
Claude analyzes your conversion data, assisted conversions, and multi-touch paths to show the full journey. It looks at first-touch vs last-touch attribution, identifies common paths (e.g., Meta prospecting → Google brand → conversion), and flags where users are falling out of the funnel at higher-than-expected rates.

## Practical example
Your ecommerce account shows that 62% of conversions involve 2+ touchpoints. The most common path is Meta prospecting ad → Google branded search → purchase. But Claude also discovers that users who see a Meta retargeting ad between those two steps convert at 3.2x the rate. Meanwhile, users who click PMax ads rarely convert on the first visit and almost never return — suggesting PMax is driving low-intent traffic. Claude recommends increasing retargeting budget for Meta-sourced traffic and re-evaluating PMax targeting.

## What you get back
- Most common conversion paths ranked by volume and conversion rate
- Average time to conversion by path and audience segment
- Drop-off points in the funnel with estimated revenue impact
- Campaign-level contribution at each funnel stage (awareness, consideration, conversion)
- Recommendations for budget and targeting adjustments based on path analysis

## When to use it
- When attribution feels murky and you need to understand the actual user journey
- Before making budget cuts to understand which "low-performing" campaigns assist conversions elsewhere
- When conversion lag is long (B2B, high-ticket ecommerce) and last-click data misleads
- During multi-channel strategy reviews
