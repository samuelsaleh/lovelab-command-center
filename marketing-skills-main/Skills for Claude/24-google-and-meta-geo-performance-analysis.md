# 24/ Geo Performance Analysis — Google + Meta

## What it does
Breaks down campaign performance by geographic location at whatever level matters — country, state, city, DMA, zip code. Flags underperforming geos that are quietly eating budget and high-performing ones that deserve more spend. Recommends geo bid adjustments or campaign splits.

## How it works
Claude analyzes your performance data segmented by location, identifies statistically significant performance differences (not just noise from low-volume areas), and calculates the cost of running campaigns in underperforming regions vs the conversions you'd lose by excluding or reducing them.

## Practical example
Your national ecommerce campaigns spend evenly across the US. Claude finds that 8 states produce 65% of your conversions at a $24 CPA, while 12 states spend $8,400/month combined with a $71 CPA and only 118 conversions. Three metro areas — Dallas, Phoenix, and Atlanta — outperform their state averages by 40%+ and could absorb more budget. Recommendation: reduce bids 40% in the 12 underperforming states, increase 25% in the top 8, and create separate campaigns for the 3 outperforming metros to give them dedicated budgets.

## What you get back
- Performance breakdown by geo level with CPA, ROAS, CVR, and volume
- Tier ranking of geos (top performers, average, underperformers) with clear thresholds
- Bid adjustment recommendations by geo with projected impact
- Campaign split recommendations for high-volume geos that deserve independent management
- Spend reallocation model showing how redistributing from weak to strong geos affects total conversions

## When to use it
- When running national or multi-market campaigns and need to optimize allocation
- After expanding into new regions to evaluate early performance
- Quarterly to catch geo performance shifts as market conditions change
- When clients ask "where should we focus" and you need data behind the recommendation
