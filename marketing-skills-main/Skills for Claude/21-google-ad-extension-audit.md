# 21/ Ad Extension Audit — Google

## What it does
Reviews all your Google Ads extensions — sitelinks, callouts, structured snippets, call extensions, image extensions, price extensions — across every campaign. Flags what's missing, what's underperforming, what's outdated, and writes replacements based on your best performing ads and landing pages.

## How it works
Claude inventories your current extensions, checks coverage (which campaigns are missing which extension types), analyzes performance data (CTR contribution, impression rates), and compares your extensions against your actual offers and landing page content to ensure they're relevant and up to date.

## Practical example
Your account has 12 campaigns. Claude finds that 4 campaigns have no sitelinks at all, 6 have sitelinks that haven't been updated in 8 months and reference a promotion that ended in Q2, and your callout extensions across the account are generic ("Free Shipping", "24/7 Support") instead of differentiated. Claude generates new sitelinks aligned to your current landing pages, writes specific callouts based on your actual value props from top-performing ad copy, and adds structured snippets using categories relevant to your product.

## What you get back
- Extension coverage map showing what's present and missing per campaign
- Performance data for existing extensions (CTR, impression rate)
- Outdated extensions flagged with what needs updating
- New extension copy written and ready to implement for each campaign
- Prioritized rollout plan starting with highest-impact gaps

## When to use it
- When setting up new campaigns to ensure full extension coverage from day one
- Quarterly extension reviews to catch outdated copy and missed opportunities
- After website changes or new product launches that make existing extensions stale
- When CTR is lower than expected and you want to improve ad real estate in search results
